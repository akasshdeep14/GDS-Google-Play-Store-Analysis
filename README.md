### GDS_Google-Play-Store-Analysis

## What I Did

Data Transformation: I cleaned a dataset of over 10k apps, converting complex strings (like "10,000+" installs or "$4.99" prices) into clean integers and floats for analysis.

Monetization & Audience Study: I identified that 92.6% of apps are Free, and the "Everyone" content rating is the primary target for developers.

Trend Analysis: I discovered a massive peak in app updates in 2018, suggesting a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market during that period.

Engagement Metrics: I mapped the "Game" and "Communication" categories as the volume leaders, each surpassing 30 billion installs.

## Tools I Used


Tableau: For creating high-level executive dashboards and treemaps.

Power BI: For building interactive reports with slicers to filter by rating and category.

The Looker Studio dashboard for the App Insights Unlocked project offers an interactive platform to analyze Google Play Store data, covering app performance metrics like categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and update patterns. It empowers stakeholders with visual tools for informed strategies in app development and marketing.

Key Features - 

Interactive filters enable drilling down by category, content rating, app type, and time, revealing trends and opportunities. Dynamic charts transform raw data into actionable insights on user engagement and market dynamics. Real-time monitoring supports benchmarking against top performers.

Performance Insights- 

Productivity, Education, and Health apps show higher average ratings, signaling strong user trust. Games and Communication categories dominate installs but demand ongoing innovation for quality. Free and freemium models lead in volume, while paid apps often secure better ratings due to elevated expectations.

Strategic Trends - 

Frequent updates correlate with sustained engagement, with activity rising over time. Optimized app size boosts installs, especially in storage-limited regions. These patterns guide prioritization for user experience and growth in competitive markets.
